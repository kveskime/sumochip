##Assemblying the robot

###Motor assembly


Take one of the plates for the body and fasten the standoff screws onto it.

Apply double sided tape to one of the servo motors as shown on the picture :
![Servo taping](img/kit/11-servo-taping.jpg)

Remove the protective foil from the double sided tape.

![Servo taping](img/kit/13-servo-tape-peeling.jpg)

On level surface push the servo motors together:

![Servo taping](img/kit/14-servos-aligned.jpg)


This will ensure precise alignment of servo motors:

![Servo taping](img/kit/15-servos-taped.jpg)

Add both servos more double sided tape:

Stick the servos onto the previously assembled frame :

Add the second body panel and fasten it with bolts

###Making the plow

Print the template onto adhesive paper. Apply the printed template to the protective film on top of the aluminium sheet. Use metal shears to cut out the plow.
Place the plow into vice grips so it lines up with the dashed line as shown on the picture

Fold the protruding part 90 degrees :

Remove the plow from the vice grips and fold it by hand:

Use vice grips to apply more pressure for a more defined crease:

Fold the protruding part 45 degrees :

Drill holes with the 3mm drill bit into the points marked with red dots:

Remove the template along with the protective film:

The plow is now finished:

###Connecting the CHIP

You should carefully check the daughterboard before connecting it to the motherboard since there are many things that may go wrong when soldering the daughterboard.
It is very easy to fry the CHIP for instance if the 5V trace or 3.3 trace is shorted with ground.

Cut 1cm pieces out of heat shrink tubing and cover the phototransistors with them:

To fix the position of the heat shrink tubing on the phototransistor use a lighter.

Connect the CHIP to the daughterboard so that the headers line up and the switch is on the same side as the USB socket.

Connect the battery to the daughterboards header so that the batterys positive wire(usually marked red) faces the switch:

![Battery connected](img/kit/45-battery-connected.jpg)

Be extra careful when connecting the battery since connecting the battery incorrectly is harmful to the CHIP's PSU.

To place the battery use double sided tape and trim any wires that may poke a hole into the battery:

To hide the wires from the servo engines manage your cables this way:

![Wrapping servo wires](img/kit/50-wrapping-servo-wires.jpg)

Make sure the battery is not under heavy pressure and attach the CHIP to the body with bolts:

![Brain fixed](img/kit/52-brain-fixed.jpg)


###Connecting the line checking sensors

Assemble the sensors to the plow using nuts and bolts:

![Line sensors](img/kit/31-line-sensors-attached.jpg)

Remove the right wheel and connect the line sensor LEDs next to the servo headers and phototransistors into the headers hidden by the wheel. Nothing bad will happen if you wire the sensors incorrectly:

![Line sensors wired](img/kit/53-line-sensors-wired.jpg)


###Finishing the Robot

The last step is to fasten the wheels with screws:

![Robot assembled](img/kit/60-robot-assembled.jpg)

To run the robot turn on the switch on the daughterboard, it is to mechanically separate the battery from the robot so the robot could be stored for long periods of time without damaging the battery.
If the robot does not power on you can carefully click the power button located on the CHIP:

![Powering on](img/kit/61-powering-on.jpg)

If done correctly the LEDs near CHIP's micro-USB socket should turn on.
